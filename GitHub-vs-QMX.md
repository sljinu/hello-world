1. # QMX Feature:
Review and approval workflow

GitHub can create branches from the master branch and keep track of changes through 'Commits'. As a 'Commit' is made, comments can be added describing why commit is being made. A 'Pull' request would then be created requesting that the 'Commits' be merged into the production copy. All 'Commits' can be reviewed and compared against the 'Master' copy prior to merging. This can help encourage constant incremental updates.
