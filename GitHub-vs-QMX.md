## 1. Fork and pull workflow

GitHub allows 'collaborators' (process owners) to create a copy of the existing production 'repository' (document folder) and create local changes. These changes are called 'commits' and can be tracked over time. Each incremental change performed can be 'committed' and comments about the change can be added.
Once all updates to the document are complete, a 'pull' request can be raised. The repository administrator will be able to review the changes and if satisfied, 'merge' the changes into the 'master' branch (production stream). The repository can be setup such that only the administrator/s may 'push' changes directly into the 'master' branch.

## 2. Review changes

Every single change made between version of the documents can be tracked through 'commits'. They can even be compared in a side-by-side manner as shown below:

## 3. Browser based

Everything is browser based, including the text editor, and it uses the simple Markdown formatting syntax (see: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
