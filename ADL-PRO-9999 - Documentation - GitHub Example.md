#### 1.0 Purpose & Scope <a id="purpose-scope"/>

The objective of the *GitHub Example* is to demonstrate the capabilities of GitHub as a documentation tool, used by the Business Operations team. It will demonstrate that GitHub is audit-ready, (insert additional features required).

#### 2.0 Business Value <a id="business-value"/>

The implementation and execution of this tool will provide the following value to the business:
* Proactively transition away from Notes tools, ensuring no loss of productivity when Notes inevitably faces its demise
* Utilise open source software that is adopted and frequently used by the software development community instead of ancient Notes technology

#### 3.0 Process Diagram <a id="process-diagram"/>

The following diagrams provide the process flow. For a description of the symbols used in these diagrams, refer to the [Process Diagram Key](http://i.imgur.com/6fIcLsr.png). For direct access to the process information for external processes, click the corresponding box on the diagrams. All other actions and decisions are described in [Process Steps](http://i.imgur.com/OsQEklz) below.

However, there is no diagram. Here is a picture of a cat.

#### 4.0 Process Steps <a id="process-steps"/>

This process is described in the table following.

Note: If you are performing a role within this process as a delegate or backup, open the [Separation of Duties Matrix](http://i.imgur.com/DPsCk71.png) to ensure there is no conflict with any other role you may be performing. If there may be a conflict, consult your manager.

1. Do this
2. Do that
3. Do everything
4. Done

#### 5.0 Control Points & Measurements <a id="control-points"/>

|CP#|Control Point Description|CP Owner|Validation and/or Measurement|

#### 6.0 Resources <a id="resources"/>

The resources required to perform this process are:

#### 7.0 Roles & Responsibilities <a id="roles"/>

The roles involved in executing and supporting this procedure - and the responsibilities associated with these roles - can be found by referring to the horizontal 'swim lanes' in the Process Diagram, above.  Note that:
The responsibilities identified for each role are not the limit of task ownership for the corresponding role.
Roles are a logical grouping of tasks and do not necessarily reflect an organisational structure.
A role may be divided among several individuals.

#### 8.0 Separation of Duties <a id="sod"/>

Separation of duties (SoD) matrices demonstrate that responsibilities are defined; separations exist where required; conflicts are identified and mitigated through appropriate secondary controls; and the activities required to execute a process are accurately reflected in the tasks performed by required personnel.

The control of SoD for this process is documented in the attached MS Excel spreadsheet:
Task to Task Conflict Matrix (no conflicts exist);
Task to Role Matrix;
Role to Role Conflict Matrix (no conflicts exist); and
Role to Employee Conflict Matrix (no conflicts exist).
